ACT 1 BEGINS
EXT. RIVER SIDE-GANGA. NIGHT

The sky is crystal clear, and the moon is looking colossal--

It paints the environment in grayish-blue.

The river is sparkling, clear as glass.

The reflection of the moon is so clear that it seems that there is another moon on the river, but --

The river moon is burning from the reflection of havan-kund on the bank.

We start to hear chants from a group of Aghori Sadhus.

The chants become louder and louder and, suddenly--

The beauty of the scene turns into chaos, and all we see are madmen.

Some are throwing animals into the fire.

One Aghori is drinking his piss, and another is dancing naked.

Some of them are high on ganja.

A few of them are playing with the human skull, and another one is eating his arm.

We move towards the fire, and there we see a civilized Aghori.

A few of them are bowing down to him, and he is Meditating with a --

The child beside him staring into the fire, emotionless.

The leader opens his eyes; the reflection of the fire gives his eyes a divine shine.

He is smiling as if he has attained nirvana, and he moves his head towards the kid.

With the divine smile he says--
Aghori
Sansar se upar ek bhagwaan hai, aur sansar me chuppe saare haiwaan hai. Apne aas paas dekh rahe ho? Inhe nahi pata ye kya kar rahe hai, aur mazze ki baat yeh hai ki iss duniya me kisi ko nahi pata wo kya kar rahe hai, wo bus wahi kar rahe hai jo sab kar rahe hai. Aur hum unke liye pagal hai aur wo hummare liye.
The leader suddenly grabs the kid threateningly, and for no reason, there is a --
Shiver in his voice, he is scared of something. But what? We don’t know.
He comes back to his senses and starts to Whisper-- 
AGHORI
Nishiddh cheeze nishiddh kyun hai? ye bus humme pata hai. Agar ishwar tak tumhe jana hai toh Sahi galat ke beech me chunao nahi, kuch sahi aur kuch galat karna padega. Aur har galat kaam me milega tumko zindigi ka asli maksad.
As He applies ash on the kid’s forehead,
We hear, The barking of dogs and the distant sound of blowing shankh.
AGHORI
Ab tum humme se ek ho aur tumhe 7 khoon maaf hai. saatve khoon ke baad tum mere saath swarg chalna aur jab tak mann karre toh...
The child grabs ash from around and throws it into the eyes of the leader. He looks around for a second and --
He escapes from the bank. The Aghoris start to run behind the kid but--
AgHORI
Jaane do, Wo humse door nahi bhaag raha, wo apne niyati ke pass jaa raha hai.
EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT
The kid is running as fast as he can, he is constantly screaming for his mother, and out of nowhere --
A truck comes speeding up towards him.
The screen turns white.
FADE out.
INT. ROOM. DAY- 2005
Blood on the floor, dead dove and remarkably organized room of a girl, with a neat study table, pink and purple curtains and a single bed with floral bed sheet.
A 10 years old girl is sitting on the bed, having a knife in her hand, dripping with blood.
The mother of the girl enters the room, she sees the dead dove and then the girl.
MOTHER
empathy
Oh!! Piyusha..
She hugs her.
CUT TO:
Present Year, Bangalore. We hear a group singing Happy Birthday.
INT. OFFICE(WITH CUBICLES). DAY-
On top of the cake, “Happy Birthday Piyusha” is written.
In the small crowd we can easily figure out our main character PURUSHOTTAM(25).
He is visibly bored, forcefully singing. But his dress --
His dress is perfectly ironed, his tie is --perfectly tied and his shoes, well they are the shiniest thing in the office.
His eyes are stuck on Piyusha, looking towards her with love and passion and as soon as Piyusha looks at him, he....
He leaves the office hurriedly. 
EXT. COFFEE stall. EVENING-
Purushottam, while drinking coffee, is talking to one of his friends over the phone.
PURUSHOTTAM
Yaar, water park toh mushkil hoga.
On his phone, he looks at his bank balance..
PURUSHOTTAM
Wo thoda office ka kaam hai, isiliye. (responding to a question) Haan kaam toh sahi milta hai, tere jitna exciting nahi hai, magar mast hai.
His voice doesn’t compliment his facial expression. He is not satisfied with his current job.
Puru completes his coffee, and while over the phone, he gets on his bike and starts riding.
PuRUSHOTTAM
Water park chor, Aaj raat cs Biryani aa jao.. 
Friend (O.S.)
Nahi mein tere taraf Nashedi nahi biryani ka.
PURUSHOTTAM
Bhai no joke, cs ki biryani kabhi khayega toh kahi aur ki nahi kha payega. World ki best biryani deta hai.
FRIEND (O.S.)
Ek kaam kyun nahi karta? Tu ek blog start kar naa khud ka aur CS Biryani ke baare mein likh, magar Tumhe apne job se fursat kaha milegi, star coder.
PURUSHOTTAM
Haan kaam pehle, chal gaadi chala raha hoon, Abhi rakhte hai.
We slowly move away from Purushottam. He has stopped his bike on a red signal surrounded by a vehicles.
This time, Purushottam again pops out of the crowd.
He is the only one having a smile on his face. 
EXT. OLD WORN-DOWN APARTMENT(PURU’S APARTMENT). EVENING
Puru parks his bike and goes inside the apartment.
INT. APARTMENT. EVENING - 
He is ringing the bell for a long time now.
He wants to shout, but--
He takes a deep breath, tries to calm himself down. He rings the bell once more, and no one opens the door.
He stands silently for a couple of seconds.
After a deep breath, aggressively, he tries to knock on the door, But the door is opened by SUDHEER(25, TALL)
Sudheer has wrapped a towel around his waist; he just took a bath.
Sudheer stares at him and says --
Sudheer
Bro, you lost your keys no? Let me have bath in peace. Go and get new keys da.
Purushottam is tired, and in no mood to argue and being excited to pitch his idea to Sudheer, he in ebullience says --
PURUSHOTTAM
Bro, ek idea hai.
SUDHEER
What?
PURUSHOTTAM
Dude learn hindi.
SUDHEER
You first learn local language.
Annoyed, Purushottam tries to calm down.
PURUSHOTTAM
I have an idea, we can get rid of our useless jobs. But first let us have biryani.
SUDHEER
Smiling
This is life da,(smiling) Rid of useless job.
PURUSHOTTAM
We are going to Cs no?
SUDHEER
Obviously machcha, How can we miss Biryani Fridays? Piyusha’s birthday no today?
PURUSHOTTAM
Yeah.
SUDHEER
Did you ask her out? 

EXT. MAIN ROAD. NIGHT -
Sudheer is riding the bike with Purushottam sitting behind.
Purushottam is looking at a video of Prakhar where he is explaining a verse from Madhushala.
The verse is basically about if you are getting high just with the thought of getting high, you are following your passion.
INT. CS BIRYANI. NIGHT - 
The place is full of police officers.
Most of them are drunk.
As Sudheer and Puru walk towards the only empty seat that they can find, their eyes are stuck at a phone used by a police officer, whose nameplate reads -- “Surender KOLI.”
Purushottam and Sudheer look at each other with utter disbelief and disgust.
As they take a seat, a waiter recognizes them and prompts them that he will bring the special Biryani for them.
SudHEER
Was he watching child porn?
PuruSHOTTAM
And he is a police officer. Wasn’t he supposed to protect us?
SUDHEER
Shame on them, even kids are not safe now a days.
Biryani is served to them with two chilled bottles of Beer.
It is delicious.
While Sudheer brings the plate near him, Purushottam stops him.
PURUSHOTTAM
Let me take a few nice pictures.
Sudheer is confused as to why is he doing it?...
PURUSHOTTAM
We can start our own food blog, if we love Biryani, we should earn from it.
Purushottam, after taking a couple of pictures, allows themselves to start eating.
SuDHEER
Food blogging? 
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi hoga mujhse?
SUDHEER
What?
PURUSHOTTAM
Can’t I do it?
SUDHEER
Depends magga, when was the last time you tried something and you succeeded?
PURUSHOTTAM
Never actually. (Puru is visibly upset and to change the topic), But we need money, I can’t do this forever?
SUDHEER
You should try to get in touch with your father bro, He might be a changed person?
PURUSHOTTAM
Upset
I’m never talking to him, I don’t know how he escaped from judiciary. Leave it, what about your parents?
SUDHEER
Those fuckers are still alive. They always see my akka earning in lacs and are proud of her. They called me yesterday just to tell Akka gifted them a car.
PURUSHOTTAM
Your Akka is also an engineer no? How many years of experience?
SUDHEER
Two.
PURUSHOTTAM
And she earns so much? No doubt parents are proud of her. But they should not make comparisons.
SUDHEER
What she earns man? She is an office slut da, sleeping around with everyone to climb up the ladder. At least I’m not doing anything wrong for the money. 
PURUSHOTTAM
Just take some money from your akka and leave the company to do what you love, make films.
SUDHEER
Take money from akka(chuckles), Wait I’ll freshen-up a bit and come.
Sudheer goes to the washroom.
The OWNER(45, FAIR, MIDDLE STATURE) of the shop comes to the table, and On seeing the plates only half empty, he says
OWNER
Achcha nahi kya aaj ka? Itne dheere dheere kha rahe ho?
PURUSHOTTAM
Dheere dheere kha ke mazza lene dijiye. I wonder aisa kya unique daalte ho aap isme?
OWNER
Dil, dil se banate hai aur aap sab ke tareef hi toh asli kamayi hai meri.
PURUSHOTTAM
Arre toh aaj ka biryani free naa?
OWNER
Smiling
Aur koi seva sir?
Purushottam takes out his phone to show his photographs to the owner. But on seeing Sudheer, he puts it back in his pocket.
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi bus kaafi hai. Dukaan kab tak khule rahegi?
OWNER
Bus sir ye police wagera chale jaaye, dukaan band kar denge.
SUDHEER
Ek plate pack kar diiyega, raat me mazze se khayenge.
CuT TO:
EXT.MAIN ROAD. NIGHT-
The road is almost empty.
Purushottam is driving the bike, and Sudheer is behind him. 
SUDHEER
On a second thought bro, our blogging thing can work. 
PuRUSHOTTAM
Really?
SUDHEER
Yeah, I saw one article today, wait will show you.
He tries to find his phone, but it’s not in his pocket.
He is panicking and searching for his phone in desperation.
SudHEER
Stop the bike machcha.
PURUSHOTTAM
Why da?
SUDHEER
I think I lost my phone?
PURUSHOTTAM
What where?
SUDHEER
First stop the bike.
Purushottam pulls over the bike.
PURUSHOTTAM
You left it in the Biryani place?
SUDHEER
Very tensed
I think machcha. Call the restaurant once.
Purushottam calls the restaurant, but no one answers. Sudheer snatches the phone and redials many times.
INT.KITCHEN-CS BIRYANI. 
The white telephone is ringing.
A blood-drenched hand reaches the phone, but the phone stops ringing.
EXT.MAIN ROAD. CONTD
SUDHEER
Lets go and collect.
PURUSHOTTAM
Machcha we will go there 1st thing in the morning, it will take at least 30minutes to reach today.
SUDHEER
Bro, please let’s go now.
PURUSHOTTAM
I’m tired bro, please.
SUDHEER
I have something important da, please.
PURUSHOTTAM
Your phone is locked, it is a good place, don’t worry. 
SUDHEER
Bro, please go, Mein poora time tumse Hindi me baat karunga.
Purushottam stares at Sudheer for a few seconds.
PURUSHOTTAM
Tumhe Hindi aati hai?
SUDHEER
Bohot achche se.
PURUSHOTTAM
Bhosdike toh ye natak kyun karta tha?
SUDHEER
Yaar tum bohot gyaan chodta hai Hindi mein, sahi galat maan maryada, english me tumko words nahi milte toh tu chup hi rehta hai almost.
PURUSHOTTAM
Behenchod aur tmko madad chahiye mujhse ?
SUDHEER
Please bhai kar de.
Purushottam, without uttering a single word, puts back the key on the bike. And they head towards CS Biryani.
CUT TO:
EXT. CS BIRYANI. NIGHT
The restaurant is closed, and both of them are standing there  -- hopelessly.
PuRUSHOTTAM
Chill, peeche ka rasta hai ek, inka door me problem hai, thoda push dene se khul jayega. 
SUDHEER
Tumko kaise pata?
PURUSHOTTAM
Bhaiya repair ke liye baat kar raha the toh sune the, abhi chal peeche se chalte hai le lenge.
EXT. BACKSIDE-CS BIRYANI
We see smoke all around with a large bin on the right corner of White, huge doors that lead to the kitchen of the restaurant.
As they enter, we move up to see a C.C.T.V camera recording them.
INT.KITCHEN-CS BIRYANI
--Lights flickering...
As they move towards the washroom, their eyes get stuck on the floor.
They look at each other with disbelief.
Terror-stricken, Sudheer swallows his saliva, and Purushottam has his sight fixed, slowly we move towards their sight, and we see --
--BLOOD, blood oozing out of the PANTRY, covering the nearby floor.
TIP... TIP. TIP... TIP... Blood dripping.
An arm of a woman, covered with blood, is stuck between the doors.
--Knife cutting through Flesh.
Is she being chopped?
Yes, It is a no brainer for them that there is a dead body inside being chopped. Suddenly they hear --
THUMPING...
--Footsteps are loud and scary, and with each step, they become louder.
Sudheer and Purushottam, in less than no time, comes back to their senses and -- 
They hide behind the preparation area in the left corner, the blood stained telephone is on top of it.
The owner enters the kitchen from the door that opens up to the restaurant, he has an alarm clock in his hand.
He peeps into the Pantry, and slowly he makes his way towards the preparation area behind which they are hiding.
OwNER
Meat ready hai? teesre pot me daal do. 
The butcher comes out of the pantry, and the owner sits on the compartment.
A key falls on the ground, but no one notices it.
He sees blood on the telephone.
OWNER
Struggle tha kya?
BUTCHER
Nahi nahi, phone uthane gaya tab tak cut ho gaya tha.
As he puts the clock on top of it, he says...
Owner
1 hour me sab khatam kar ke ghar ko chalo. unke aane se pehle nikal jana.
Butcher
Sir iss se ek week chal jayega, magar bodies aur chahiye.
OWNER
Salman ke badle koi mil jayega, tab tak mutton daal dena, zada pata nahi chalega. Abhi chalta hoon tm jao kaam khatam karo, aur suno ye darwaza me tala laga ke nikaliyo.
The owner starts to leave the kitchen heading towards the backdoor.
The butcher goes back inside the pantry.
The light flickers several times, and as he reaches the exit door, he notices that the door is Ajar. 
He looks back for a second.
SWOOSH!!
The wind blows a couple of his hairs.
-- Complete silence for a few seconds.
He notices his keys on the floor. 
Dawdling, he reaches for the keys, Beside which there are shoe marks, not of one shoe, but two.
He looks at his shoe. The patterns don’t match.
With his fingers, he kind of plays some music on top of the compartment, smiling.
With that smile on his face, he leaves.
As he leave, Purushottam and Sudheer take a sigh of relief.
The ticking of the clock is amplified with the silence of the place.
It seems that the whole world, the --God and the --Devil is looking at them silently, except that clock.
The clock keeps ticking.
CUT TO:
EXT.MAIN ROAD. 
The bike is standing at the side of the road, but the engine is still running.
The Biryani that they got packed is hanging on the handle, swinging like a pendulum.
Purushottam is vomiting. 

SuDHEER
May be they serve meat to high profile people, Humme regular Biryani hi de rahe the.
PURUSHOTTAM
angry
Kabhi aisi biryani khaayi hai?
They both are silent for a few seconds.
SUDHEER
Police ke pass challe?
PURUSHOTTAM
Frustrated
Haan chalte hai, Restaurant me kabhi police ko kab dekhe hai?
SUDHEER
Social media?
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi, they will find a way to track us back, Agar wo insaan khaate toh, toh humme ya tumhari family ko maarne me kitna time lagayenge?
SUDHEER
We can’t simply run away.
PURUSHOTTAM
Kuch galat dekh ke aankh band karna bhi utna hi galat hai.
SUDHEER
Do we know any police officer ?
PURUSHOTTAM
Akash uncle, Akshay ke papa police me hai na?

CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT. NIGHT
Being restless and scared, Sudheer and Purushottam are walking To and FRO inside the small room.
SUDHEER
But if there is at least 1 percent chance ki Uncle bhi mile hue ho, we are fucked.
PurUSHOTTAM
Unko mail likhte hai anonymously.
SUDHEER
Mail se wo humme track kar lenge.
PURUSHOTTAM
Ek note printout krte hai aur Akshay ke ghar me chor kar aate hai.
SUDHEER
Han ye theekh rahega.
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi nahi if we are wrong toh unke liye suspects narrow down ho jayenge.
SUDHEER
Unke police thaana ke bahar note chorte hai.


CUT TO:
EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
Sudheer and Purushottam are drinking coffee outside the station.
There is a paper note peaking out of Purushottam’s pocket.
The weather is gloomy, and we can constantly hear thunder.
PURUSHOTTAM
Gaadi on rakh.
SuDHEER
Sunn casually... Zada nervous nahi dikhna.
Purushottam Nervously nods his head in positive..
INT. POLICE STATION. DAY
Purushottam enters the station and looks around for a second.
All the police officers are busy...
He casually takes out his phone from his pocket, and in the process, the note falls.
As he starts to leave with a notorious smile on his face.
Police 1
In Kannada
Apka paper gir gaya.
--LIGHTNING
Purushottam’s face is lit with the thunder, --disquieted He turns back.
PurUSHOTTAM
No, no not mine.
POLICE 1
It fell from your pocket.
PURUSHOTTAM
Sure?
POLICE 1
Aah!! leave it.
He places the note on the top of one table. The table’s nameplate read --Akash Tripathy. Puru is staring at the note with desperation.
--RING... RING...
The police pick up his phone and leave the station.
Puru quickly moves toward the note, but
Akash TRIPATHY
Arre puru!! Station mein?
Unable to pick up the note, he turns around.
AKASH TRIPATHY, while sitting on his chair, picks up the note. He is about to read it.
PURUSHOTTAM
Wo uncle, phone chori ki report likhani hai.
Akash folds the note and keeps it back on the table. He signals Puru to take a seat.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Tumhara?
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi nahi sudheer ka.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Arre wo bahar sudheer hi tha kya? Andar bula lo baarish hogi abhi.
PURUSHOTTAM
Scared, gulping dry
Haan uncle. Thoda jaldi nikalna hai, Office ka kaam hai.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Report (points his hand toward other table), waha jaa ke likhwa lo.
Purushottam is staring at the note. He is petrified, but at the same time, desperate to run away with the note. 
AKASH TRIPATHY
Kya hua? Udhar Amit ke pass jao. (Shouts) Amit iska report likh lo
Puru nods his head and slowly starts to move toward the other table.
Akash keeps the note inside his drawer.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Waise kaha ghuma tha phone?
PuRUSHOTTAM
Wo... 
Police 1 enters the room. 
PURUSHOTTAM
Cs biryani me, wo 9Th phase me jo hai.
Police 1
Arre CS biryani? Waha toh week mein do baar jaate hai sir.
AkASH TRIPATHY
Haan, wahi pe chutta tha naa? Report wagera nahi likhwao. Mil jayega. Mein owner ko jaanta hoon waha ke.
Purushottam gulps.. He knows he should not have uttered that name.
--LIGHTNING --Thunder.
PuRUSHOTTAM
Thank you uncle.. Uncle jo note aapne abhi andar rakha hai, wo mera hai, de sakte hai kya?
Police 1 stares at him. He is --Suspicious..
Akash takes out the note from his drawer.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Ye?
He opens the note to read it.
PURUSHOTTAM
Uncle read mat kariye naa. Love letter hai.
Akash folds it and gives it back to Purushottam.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Kaun love letter aise start karta hai? This is a bone-chilling information?
PURUSHOTTAM
Uncle wo crime novels ki bohot badi fan hai. Isiliye......
AKASH TRIPATHY
Tum padhte ho crime novels?
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi uncle.
AKASH TRIPATHY
Achcha theekh hai tum ghar jao, phone mil jana chahiye.
Police 1 knows something is fishy.
PoLICE 1
Sir aap wo book padhiyega, the Custom of the sea, Bohot sahi hai.
Purushottam, nods his head.
EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
Drizzling!!
Purushottam sits behind sudheer.
SUDHEER
Itna time kyun lag gaya?
PURUSHOTTAM
Wo akash ke papa se baat cheet ho gayi thi.
SUDHEER
Note chor diya?
PURUSHOTTAM
Ghar chal sab bata ta hoon.
INT. APARTMENT. DAY
Sudheer is disappointed.
SUDHEER
Shouting
Kya chutiya hai yaar tu? Report likhwaane ki kya zaroorat thi?
PuRUSHOTTAM
Yaar kuch sujha nahi mujhe. Ghabrahat mein kuch bhi bol diya.
SUDHEER
See we have to drop this now.
PURUSHOTTAM
Obviously, we tried. I’m not even sure ki uncle nahi mille hue hai ye sab mein. 
SUDHEER
It’s not our duty anymore. We will try again after some months. 
PURUSHOTTAM
It’s cowardly. Not to do anything.
SUDHEER
Did you leave us with any other option.
Purushottam is disappointed in himself.
PURUSHOTTAM
Have you read The Custom of the Sea?
SUDHEER
Yeah, fantastic book about survival.
PURUSHOTTAM
That police man suggested me to read it.
SUDHEER
Kya?
PURUSHOTTAM
He suggested me to read it.
SUDHEER
Do you even know the full name of the book?
PURUSHOTTAM
No.
SUDHEER
The Custom of the Sea: The shocking true story of cannibalism and survival.
They both know that they are fucked.
PURUSHOTTAM
We should pack our bags.
Ding! Dong!
The bell rings.
SUDHEER
Darwaza locked hai?
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi.
They slowly reach the drawing hall,
The door is ajar.
The bell rings again!! This time with a KNOCK.
OwNER
Sir aapka phone choot gaya tha, police sahib phone kar ke bole.
The door opens, creaking.
The owner is drenched with water.
OwnER
Oh sorry thoda baarish me bheeng gaya. Koi issue nahi naa andar aaun?
Sudheer and Purushottam, Trembling, cannot utter a word. 
OWNER
Arre khaunga nahi aapko.(pause) Abhi...
He is also holding carry bag, the carry bag of CS Biryani.
PURUSHOTTAM
Th.. th.. thank you bhaiya.
Purushottam moves towards the door and takes the phone, and he hands it over to Sudheer.
The phone is covered in plastic to safeguard it from rain.
While unwrapping it...
SuDHEER
whispers
Tune address diya tha police ko?
PURUSHOTTAM
Akash se maang liye honge uncle.
As they look up, The owner is standing dangerously close to them.
OWNER
Sir aap log ko itna kasht hua uske liye biryani bhi le lo, aapka favorite hai, CS special biryani.
The owner leaves the biryani on the table and leaves.
All of a Sudden!
The owner enters the home again and locks the door from within.
Purushottam and Sudheer could feel nothing but blind terror, dread twisted in their guts, they stood still.
OWNER
Apne ko lamba baat pasand nahi. Kal tmlog kitchen me tha.
He pulls out a pistol and keeps it on the table.
They both are shivering..
OWNER
Arre darro nahi, chalo baitho, tumlog ka hi ghar hai.
Sudheer gathers some courage and with raw panic in his voice, he says
SuDHEER
We are not a threat to you. Humlog koi khatra nahi paida karnege.
OWNER
Maan liye. 

Silence...
The owner is smiling...
OwNER
Tumlog ko laga ki ek simple police case aur ye sab band? Jo hum kar rahe hai wo yugo-yugo se chal raha hai.
He takes out one of the biryanis from the bag and starts to eat it.
OWNER
Aao tumlog bhi kha lo.
They don’t move an inch.
After a couple of bites, he packs the biryani again.
OWNER
Tum(Pointing puru) Kya naam hai tera? Puru? Wo gun dena thoda, mera haath nahi jaa raha.
The time slows down.
Puru is covered with sweat. Each drop that crawls over his skin has numbed his face. He can’t feel anything, except
--fear.
Without his consent, His legs start moving towards the table.
As he grabs the pistol, The owner very curiously is observing Purushottam, with a devilish smile on his face. He is waiting for puru to do something crazy. Sudheer closes his fist as his body gets filled with a sudden pulse of energy.
Deep down, they both know that the pistol may be empty, but isn’t it their last chance?
In no time Puru grabs the pistol with both of his hands and COCKING!!!! Of gun is heard while he loads the gun and
Bam!! The trigger is
--JAMMED.
OWNER
Very good, toh jaan lene se aapko koi parhaiz nahi, bus ek karan ki awashakta hai.
Sudheer furiously starts to talk, only to be abruptly silenced by the owner.
OWNER
Um mm hmm mm, shhhhh,ch.. ch.. chup.. Tum dono ke pass bus do options hai. One-> ya toh ab mere liye dead bodies tum log lao, ya option 2--> agla do bodies tumlog hoge.
The owner again unpacks the biryani and starts eating it, this time he is enjoying the bites.
PurUSHOTTAM
Bodies?? Laate kaha se ho?
OWNER
Tum free ho jaha se bhi lao, Last wala gareebo se bachche khareed kar lata tha.
PURUSHOTTAM
Khareed kar? 
OWNER
Arre haan, paise wagera hum de denge. tumhara kaam hai, cleanly, bina maatha pachchi ke, bodies lana. Help will be provided.
SuDHEER
And people sell their kids? To be eaten?
OWNER
Humko angrezi aati hai, magar jawab hum hindi mein denge? Ok naa? Koi problem nahi? Hoga bhi toh (smirks) jhaant kuch ukhaado ge. Unko nahi pata hota tha, and no one cares, salman pooch ke lata tha, uss se pehle waala seedha utha leta tha.
PuRUSHOTTAM
Bachcho ko?
OWNER
Nahi gareebo ko, see no one cares ek gareeb zinda hai ki nahi. Koi report bhi nahi banata. They are not meant to be alive.
The owner takes out a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it over to sudheer.
OwNER
Ye rules hai, kaise bodies humme nahi chahiye. Tum itmanan se padh lena, But we don’t want anyone suffering from cancer, raped or in periods. Baaki niyam todd sakte ho.
He offers biryani to them, but they both refuse to eat it.
OWNER
Ab nahi kha kar kya ukhaad loge? Ye marr chuke hai, and the best part tumne nahi maara. Eat guilt free.
He revolves around them.
OWNER
Don’t lie, ki tumhe ye meat tasty nahi lagte. isko dekh kar tumhare muh me paani nahi aate. 
He pats them both and says.. 
OWNER
Month me ek body minimum laana hoga”, aur kal subah tak ka waqt hai tumlogo ke pass. Nahi karna hai toh aur sahi, next kuch weeks ke liye body mil jayegi mujhko.
He leaves one biryani there and walks out of the home elegantly.
CuT TO:
INT. ROOM. NIGHT-
One old Godrej almirah is standing still in the corner opposite to the window.
Sudheer and purushottam are sitting quietly, tensed.
Purushottam is lost deep into some thought.

PURUSHOTTAM
Usne kaha tha har tarah ka help provide karega.
SUDHEER
So we will buy kids?
PURUSHOTTAM
No, we will kill criminals.
Sudheer is astonished.
SUDHEER
That way, we will be doing the right thing?
PURUSHOTTAM
Small criminals, jisko police nahi pakad rahi, but they deserve to die.
SUDHEER
Angry
We will decide Who deserve to die? 
Purushottam gives him a deadly stare.
PURUSHOTTAM
Do we deserve to live?
SUDHEER
What’s the plan?
PURUSHOTTAM
Help will be provided, hum unse weapons, criminals ke list aur paisa lenge.
SUDHEER
Hm criminals ko maar payenge?
PURUSHOTTAM
I don’t know. Pata nahi kya karna hai. But iske alawa kuch hai jo hum kar sakte hai?
Sudheer nods in negative.
SUDHEER
How many criminals will we kill each month?
PURUSHOTTAM
Minimum number. We will have 2 rules, Rule 1- kill criminals, rule 2- only 1 criminal per month.
SUDHEER
And what if we break rule 2?
PURUSHOTTAM
Surrender.
Sudheer is irritated.
SUDHEER
Ye bhi risky hai.
PURUSHOTTAM
So what do we do? Kill poor children?
SUDHEER
We will have to.
PURUSHOTTAM
What if you have to kill me? Mujhe bhi maar doge? We are good humans and we....
SUDHEER
Oh! Come on shut up. If I can kill you for my survival. You can kill me to just look good. Tumhe bus achcha dikhna hai, tum ek image bana ke jeena chahte ho. I can see right through your act.
PURUSHOTTAM
Mujhe pata hai mein achcha hoon.
SUDHEER
Killing your father, could have made you good. 
PURUSHOTTAM
Sudheer chup ho ja.
SUDHEER
Agar tum waha gaand me damm dikhata, you could have saved your mother.
PURUSHOTTAM
Sudheer chup ho ja.
SUDHEER
You killed her, because you did not kill him.

PUNCH...
Sudheer falls down. 
Lips bleeding.
Purushottam kicks sudheer hard, but sudheer dodges the attack.
In pain, he stands up.
Furious, he grabs purushottam by neck, almost chocking him, pushing him against the almirah.
SUDHEER
I can kill you right now, but I won’t. Kyun ki mein sirf achcha dikhna nahi chahta. I’m good.
Sudheer leaves purushottam, as purushottam steps away from the almirah, the door slowly opens and a letter falls out of it; flying , it reaches Sudheer’s foot.
Picking it up purushottam bursts into tear.
Silence..
He sits beside purushottam.
PURUSHOTTAM
I still write letters to my mom, Wo maaf nahi karegi mujhe, agar mein murderer bann jaun.
He wants to hug him, but the only thing he says...
SuDHEER
Chal sutta maarte hai do.
INT. DRAWING HALL. NIGHT -
DARK!
They both come out of the room and see the biryani lying over there.
Like every meat lover, who once pledged not to eat meat ever, they go out of the house.
We move up to see the clock.
In fifteen minutes they come back.
They look at each other, without uttering any single word,
Sudheer walks towards the table, opens the package and start eating the biryani.
Purushottam joins him.
Complete silence.
The clock on the wall is ticking, it seems that everyone, The --GOD and the -DEVIL are watching them silently, except that clock.
The clock keeps ticking.
                     ACT 1 ENDS                            
ACT 2 
INT.KITCHEN-CS BIRYANI. DAY
The stove is lit, the bluish flame engulfs the frying pan and burns the oil inside, leaving the screen covered with the white smoke.
We hear the Whir of an electric juicer, Bacon sizzling, the sizzle of meat hitting a hot grill, and an angry cook.
As the cook moves, the smoke dissipates, giving us the view of the busy kitchen.
We slowly move towards the door with a window on the center top.
Purushottam and Sudheer are pitching their idea to the owner.
The owner could not stop his laughter.
As we move inside the window, the sound of the kitchen fades away.
OwNER
laughing
Yaar tum dono toh cracked piece aaye ho mere pass. Mein help nahi kar raha. Bohot simple hai aur safe toh hai, jao gareebo ko utha ke lao kaam khatam.
PURUSHOTTAM
Tumhe darr kis baat ki hai? Ki hum tumhe maarenge?
The owner bursts into tears and almost mechanically becomes serious.
OWNER
Koi bhi criminal, mere customers ke alawa.
SUDHEER
Done.
OWNER
Gareeb bachcho ko marna, zada insaniyat ka kaam hai waise. Unki zindigi nark se bhi battar hoti hai, Ya toh jism ke dhandhe me laga diye jaate hai, ya toh viklang kar ke bhikhari bana diye jaate hai. 
PURUSHOTTAM
Insaniyat ke liye kar rahe ho ye sab?
The owner looks at him solemnly, almost in a threatening way...
OWNER
Ek criminal hai mere nazar me, zada khatarnaak nahi hai. Police ke laparwahi se bach gaya tha, kisi bade aadmi ka haath bhi nahi hai uspe.
PURUSHOTTAM
Crime?
OWNER
Acid...
The owner calls up someone and asks for the bio-data of the guy.
OWNER
Mein police se criminals jugaad toh kar lunga, magar sahi aur galat ke beech me chunao karna hummara kaam nahi.

The owner pulls out the same pistol and hands it over to Purushottam.
He grabs Puru's hand and puts the revolver in the middle of his own throat.
OWNER
Seedha gale pe maarna..
Purushottam’s index finger becomes firm, and it looks like he will pull the trigger.
OwNER
Sir pe ya pait pe ya aise koi jagah nahi maarna jiss se meat kharab ho.
He removes the revolver from his throat and asks Purushottam to keep it inside.
OWNER
Ladki ne suicide kar liya. Police ne apni laparwahi chupa li. Aaj bhi uska baap har din court jata hai. 
Suddenly he drops his act of being serious and starts laughing again.
OWNER
Mein bhi tum logo ke saath messiah  messiah khelega, bohot mazza aaya. Dekh mujhe koi matlab nahi kisi ko bhi maaro, kissi ko bhi kaato jitne jaldi bodies le aao, utna achcha.
Scared, dejected, and finally realizing that they are a part of this, Puru and Sudheer start to leave the office.
OWNER
Bachcha log Nishiddh cheeze nishiddh kyun hai? Jab pata lag jaayega, toh jo lakir tum sahi aur galat ke beech taan rahe ho wo ya toh patli ho jayegi ya toh mit jayegi. Khuda Kaun hai? Jante ho? 
PURUSHOTTAM
Agar tum bachche khareed sakte ho. Toh tumhe hummari ya kisi ki bhi kya zaroorat hai?
OWNER
SMILING
Hai. Khuda bann ne nahi chalo,(Smiling, playfully) wo post meri hai.
PURUSHOTTAM
A God is someone who cares, who provide justice.
OWNER
Laughing
Look around the God is dead.
Silence...
They leave.
EXT. OUTSIDE CHURCH. NIGHT-
MATHEW(31, wearing a black overcoat) comes out of the church and walks towards a narrow street.
Purushottam starts to follow him.
He is holding a mask in his right hand which, he wears while following him.
EXT. DESERTED ALLEYWAY
Mathew knows the route very well, and he knows that there is nothing to be scared of in this safe locality. 
But tonight, tonight is different. 
He notices someone is following him, a masked man. 
He increases his pace, and in no time, he starts running, only to see another masked man standing at the end of the street. 
Dogs, barking!!!
Puru takes out the pistol. 
Mathew tries to push Sudheer(in the mask) to escape, but
--BAM!!
He is punched hard on his gut. He falls down on his knees, struggling in pain.
Purushottam grabs his head and shows him the picture of a girl.
PURUSHOTTAM
Do you remember her?
With fear in his eyes oozing out in tears, he nods his head in positive.
Purushottam hits him hard on his nut.
Mathew is in unbearable pain.
He sticks the pistol on his neck.
PuRUSHOTTAM
This is what you deserve.
Mathew
         (kannada)
I tried to confess, they did not let me.
PURUSHOTTAM
kannada
Does it really matter?
MATHEW
kannada
It was 12 years ago, I tried to confess, they did not let me. I was in an asylum for the next 4 years. I have a wife now, and two daughters, they are 4 and 5 years old. I’m a changed person now.
His grip on the revolver loosens.
The cross that Mathew is wearing on his neck gets entangled in the barrel of the revolver.
MaTHEW
begging
Please let me go. I beg you.
SuDHEER
It is too late, he is an easy kill, Next time ka wait nahi kar sakte.
Purushottam’s eyes are filled with fear, doubts, and pity.
Puru is trying to pull the trigger, but he can’t.
His arm is shaking.
Sudheer notices it.
SUDHEER
No matter what, he is a criminal. He deserve to die.
Purushottam brings down the revolver.
Perplexed and afraid, he stands still.
SUDHEER
He destroyed her life, her family.
Sudheer shouts “Puru” to bring him back to his senses.
Purushottam slowly raises his head. He is not ready to kill.
SUDHEER
Tera baap aaj dusri shaadi kar ke khush hai. But did that save your mother?
Time slows down.
Sound fades away.
Purushottam is looking at Mathew, begging for his life.
His eyes then go to Sudheer. We can not hear anything, but whatever Sudheer is saying fills Purushottam with rage.
In no time, Purushottam pulls the trigger.
The recoil breaks the chain, liberating the cross, which shines bright with the reflection of the muzzle flash.
Purushottam’s eyes get covered with splashes of blood and are instantly filled with regret and tear.
A van(White) enters the scene.
Slowly the sound fades in--
Tires drifting, Dogs barking, fluctuating sound of street light, wind.
The owner gets out of the van, and with the help of Sudheer, they put the body inside.
Purushottam is frozen in shock and horror. He is pulled inside the van by Sudheer.
INT. VAN
The owner is smiling.

Purushottam, in guilt, is unable to look up at Sudheer.
He is staring at his shoes, ensanguined with the blood of a changed man.
OwNER
Mukhti mili aisa nahi lag raha?
PuRUSHOTTAM
Uski ek family thi?
OWNER
Haan.
PURUSHOTTAM
Bataya kyun nahi?
OWNER
Iss se farq kya padta hai?
PURUSHOTTAM
Humne ek hasta khelta parivar barwaad kar diya.
The owner bursts into laughter.
OWNER
Kitne filmein dekhte ho? Kuch nahi ujaada tumne, iski patni iske upar domestic violence ka case daali hui thi. Aur dono sauteli betiyon ko beti maanta hi nahi tha ye.
Purushottam raises his head. He has a smile on his face.
BEGIN FLASH BACK - 1:
INT. SMALL ROOM. NIGHT-
The room is lit dimly. We hear the screaming of a woman, whipping of a belt.
Purushottam(10) is waiting outside the room from where the scream is coming.
JAY(34) comes out of the room. The belt is covered with blood. Purushottam is hiding a kitchen knife.
As soon as Jay sits on a chair and closes his eyes, Purushottam runs towards him.
BACK TO THE SCENE.
The car stops abruptly. Purushottam is staring at the dead body, smiling.
In Mathew’s face, he sees --
--A BLURRED FACE with no eyes, no nose, no mouth.
Fade TO BLACK.
INT. DRAWING HALL. NIGHT --
Sudheer and Purushottam are watching a movie, with two bottles of beer and two plates of cs special biryani.
It is 3 in the morning.
PURUSHOTTAM
Kal office jana hai?
SUDHEER
Mein toh nahi jaa raha, sick le lunga. Was it liberating?
PURUSHOTTAM
What?
SUDHEER
The Act of justice?
PURUSHOTTAM
Pata nahi, magar aisa laga jo kaam police, court ya society ko karna chahiye tha,Jo kaam sahi tha, wo humne kiya.
SUDHEER
Was it nice killing your father?
PURUSHOTTAM
He is still alive.
SUDHEER
Was it liberating killing your father.
He looks at Sudheer for a few seconds, grabs a couple of bites of the biryani, and then he nods his head in positive.
SUDHEER
Har month shall we kill your father or....
PuRUSHOTTAM
We will see.
Silence... 
Only the sound of television can be heard.
CUT TO BLACK.
Bad ass music(Hannah Miller - Still I Rise (Instrumental)) takes over the silence of the previous scene.
The black screen opens vertically in a similar way we open our eyes.
EXT. MAIN ROAD. DAY - 
Purushottam is driving the bike wearing a tight black t-shirt, looking hopelessly--
--handsome, Eyes filled with determination.
The screen splits into two vertical halves.
The left side of the screen is 15minutes in the past.
Purushottam is standing in front of the mirror, holding an expensive tie in his hand.
With a smile on his face, he ditches the tie.
On the right side of the screen, Purushottam parks the bike, and with it, the right side of the screen occupies the whole screen.
He lights up a cigarette and smokes it in the most fashionable way possible.
With the screen covered with smoke, we transition to--
INT. OFFICE. DAY-
The music fades out. Purushottam enters the office; his eyes wander around only to stops on Piyusha. 
AS he hesitates to approach her, He sits down inside his cubicle, works on a couple of lines of code. 
Not able to concentrate, grooving to the song playing in his head, he closes his eyes. 
The guy next to him is watching Purushottam; he is surprised.
With an “Aahh fuck it” attitude, Purushottam leaves his cubicle and...
COFFEE MACHINE AREA:
Purushottam, with all his confidence, asks Piyusha -- 
PURUSHOTTAM
Hey I have been thinking,(Hesitates)...(silence for 5 seconds). Can we go out for a coffee tonight?
Piyusha
Hey, sure. Where shall we go.
He did not expect this. Perhaps he only imagined this scenario till here. 
PIYUSHA
Siddhu’s?
PURUSHOTTAM
Yeah Siddhu’s 7pm tonight.
PIYUSHA
Yeah cool, we will leave office together then.
EXT. SIDDHU’S CAFÉ. EVENING-
The café is crowded, there is a large window in the front which gives us a clear view of the interiors.
As we move towards the window, we notice that Purushottam’s bike is parked outside.
As a waiter leaves the table right in the middle of the café, we see --
Piyusha laughing out loud on his jokes, Purushottam is having the time of his life.
He is living his life tonight.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. ROOM(PURU’S). NIGHT--
In lust, Piyusha is moaning her “Aahs.” 
Her moans get louder and louder with each stroke. 
Although they are covered with sweat, they have wrapped themselves in a white blanket. 
Her nails, painted red, are almost scratching his muscular shoulder. The bed is making a creaking sound as her legs come out of the blanket. 
The moonlight illuminates her Payal. 
With her feet together, Her legs bent together in a diamond shape over his waist. 
His hand greases over her left thigh. She feels shivers across her skin with a fluttering heart. 
The electrifying sensation gives her goosebumps all over her body.
Purushottam notices goosebumps on her neck. He bends forward to kiss it.
Piyusha throws away the blanket, which covers our screen, and paints it white.

INT. BALCONY. LATER IN THE NIGHT - 
Piyusha is wearing Purushottam’s Shirt, and he, topless, is smoking his cigarette.
Piyusha
You are different.
PURUSHOTTAM
Matlab?
PIYUSHA
We know each other from when?
PURUSHOTTAM
2 years.
PIYUSHA
Aur tum abhi try kar rahe ho?
She takes the cigarette from his hand to take a long drag.
PURUSHOTTAM
You know how world always pushes you back? Aur hum kuch nahi kar paate, I’m no more that.
PIYUSHA
While giving him the cigarette
(smiling) This was your first?
Embarrassed, Purushottam cutely nods in yes.
She gives him a paper, the same paper that The owner gave to them.
PiYUSHA
Rules for killing? 
Purushottam is surprisingly calm.
PURUSHOTTAM
I’m working on a crime novel.
PIYUSHA
On body trafficking?
PURUSHOTTAM
About two people who get trapped into a cult, forced to kill others
PIYUSHA
Forced to kill? No one can force any one to kill someone.
PURUSHOTTAM
If they don’t, Wo maare jayenge.
PIYUSHA
Police ke pass jaa sakte hai?
PURUSHOTTAM
Police mili hui hai.
PIYUSHA
Duniya ki saari police?
PURUSHOTTAM
The thing is agar wo complain kar bhi de, toh wo cult sab clean kar lega, aur wo fasne nahi waale, Ulta mere dono characters maare jayenge.
PIYUSHA
Do they enjoy killing?
PURUSHOTTAM
They kill criminals.
PIYUSHA
They murder criminals, interesting, Grey characters, tell me more.
PURUSHOTTAM
Not Grey, they are good characters, at least one of them is.
PIYUSHA
Sorry, I wanted to be a script doctor once, premise interesting hai. Mein sir nahi khaati.
PURUSHOTTAM
How are they Grey?
PIYUSHA
It’s good that they are Grey.
PURUSHOTTAM
How are they Grey?
PIYUSHA
Because they think that they are forced to kill.
PURUSHOTTAM
People in army kill terrorists, police kill criminals.
PIYUSHA
So, they are symbol of justice?
PURUSHOTTAM
Exactly, madam, justice.
PIYUSHA
Still they are Grey, A white, uninteresting character, would have found a way to escape, but a Grey character finds a way to justify their act.
Purushottam is visibly angry.
PIYUSHA
I love this novel already. And I don’t know, I’m turned on by writers.
She, seductively crawls towards Purushottam and kisses him.
faDE TO:
Int. ROOM(SUDHEER'S). LATER - 

Sudheer is buying an iPhone on his laptop. On the gift option, he writes - "To the best Mother."

He places the order and calls up his mother.
Sudheer
Telugu
Amma, How is your phone?
mother
O.S, Telugu
OK! only Beta. Why are you calling me so late? Something happened?
Sudheer
TELUGU
Nothing happened, achcha! Akka! Gifted Abba an Iphone no?

Sudheer
TELUGU
Amma, Tomorrow morning you will receive a new phone. 
mother
TELUGU
No need! I don't understand how to operate these little demons.
Sudheer
TELUGU
You will learn quickly, and you can simply stay in the AC room and watch all your serials, I just got a new job, pay is very good.
mother
TELUGU, EXCITED
Didn't I tell you? Things will get better, you only cried everyday, what will happen with 17 thousand.
Sudheer
Controlling his tears, Telugu
One and a half lac they pay per month. Amma, will call you later, have to go.
He disconnects the call, tears oozing out of his eyes with a big smile on his face.
Sudheer
Amma will be proud of me.
"4 weeks later"
INT.KITCHEN-CS BIRYANI. NIGHT - 
It is late in the night. The restaurant is closed.
Sudheer, Purushottam, and The owner is sitting around the preparation area.
Owner
Zada late nahko karo, Kab tak laoge?
PURUSHOTTAM
Tum khud kyun nahi maarte?
OWNER
Jaan na chahte ho?
They nod their heads in positive.
The owner keeps a glass on a distant table and gives Purushottam another gun.
OwNER
Aim karo.
Purushottam aims towards the glass.
OWNER
Trigger dabao.
It bullet misses the it.
OWNER
Itna ganda aim? Chalo koi nahi. Ab bandook mujhpar taano.
Purushottam hesitates.. But he does as instructed.
OWNER
Trigger dabao.
Puru is hesitant.
OWNER
Tum agar mujhe abhi maar diye, Kasai mujhe abhi pakka dega, and maa kasam tum dono free ho.(Shouts) hai ki nahi ?
The butcher from the pantry shouts Yes.
OWNER
Bus ek ungli zorr se dabani hai.
Without thinking for another second, Purushottam pulls the Trigger, But..
--It is JAMMED; AGAIN.
OWNER
Mujhe maara nahi jaa sakta.
In shock and disbelief, Sudheer says...
SUDHEER
Come on, it’s just a sick trick. Gun 1 baar hi chal sakti hogi ye.
The owner looks at him with a smile.
He goes behind Purushottam, Holds his arm, and points it towards the glass.
OWNER
Ek aankh band karo aur glass ke middle me focus.
He backs off and says..
OwNER
Jab aim baith jaaye, trigger pull karna.
With steady hands, Purushottam pulls the trigger.
BAM!!
The glass shatters. The owner raises his arms and shows Sudheer that the game is not rigged.
Purushottam, without wasting another second points the gun towards the owner and pulls the trigger.
BAM!!
The barrel slot was empty this time.
OWNER
scared, faking confidence
Oops!!! Ye toh unexpected kar diya aapne. Total 5 goli hai andar, bus ek khaali thi,  chaho toh check kar lo.
Purushottam opens the gun, and to his shock, three bullets are there.
OWNER
Saat khoon maaf hai mujhe, aur meine ab tak 4 kiye hai, toh jab tak ek dum impossible naa ho, meri jaan koi nahi le sakta.
He takes the gun from Purushottam and continues his speech...
OWNER
Tumlog ko jaan na hai naa? Ki tumlog kiss cheez me fassa hai? Mein sab bataunga. Mein bayra hoon, English me bole toh waiter, wo kasai hai, aur aap dono Shikari ho, (wildly)Hunters. Baaki questions body laane ke baad.
He gives him the list of criminals.
OWNER
Tumlog poora list dekh sakte ho, decide karo kab tak body laoge, mujhe 3 din me chahiye.
They are confused and as they are about to leave the kitchen.
OWNER
Tumlog soch vichar kar ke, number 3, Salim Ali par hi aaoge. Rapist hai, Police me bohot reach hai, aur bhagina hai Local mla ka, magar ye na body guards rakhta hai, naa bandook na koi goli.
SUDHEER
Kyu?
OWNER
6 foot 4 inch ka pehelwaan hai, nationals khelne wala tha kushti mein, magar isne crime ka rasta chuna, Aur sabka sir dard hai, Gayab hua toh koi poochega bhi nahi.
PuRUSHOTTAM
Isko hum kaise maarenge?
OWNER
Bohot bada nashedi nhai ye, har raat randi khana jaata hai; tunn ho kar. 
Bandook chalana to aata hi hai ab? Room ke andar mein pohochwa dunga tumlog ko, bus ek goli theekh gale  ke beecho beech maarni hai. Easy kill.
EXT. RED-LIGHT AREA. NIGHT-
The construction alongside the street resembles “CHAWL” of Mumbai, glamorously lit in seductive colors.
On the stairway hanging outside the buildings, a few prostitutes are waiting for their customers.
An old Kannada song is being played in one of the rooms.
The calmness of the scene is disturbed by the sound of a Bullet(motorcycle).
SALIM ALI(35,6’4), Strong muscular, Dark complexion, enters the scene on his bullet.
Like a rock star, he parks his bike.
On his way to his room, he spanks a prostitute on the stairway.
He is Charismatic.
INT. SALIM’S ROOM. CONTINUED- 
There is no one in the honeymoon suite. The room is lit in green, bed covered with petals.
Petals which does not look like it belongs to some ordinary flower, illuminating and purple.
On the side, which is close to the door, there is a makeup table with 4 feet tall mirror and a beautiful lamp.
Salim sits on the bed and opens his shirt.
The knob of the door is turned, and in no time, Sudheer and Purushottam enter the room.
They lock the room.
They are wearing loose shirts and bell-bottom pants, and they look like someone pulled straight out of 70’s movies.
Salim ali
Kannada
Where are the girls, and just fuck off and go to your fancy dress competition.
He is not even remotely scared of the fact that two men entered the room and locked the door.
He takes out his cigar and starts to smoke it.
PurUSHOTTAM
in style
Today, we will fuck you.
SALIM ALI
Smiling
Tum dono north se hai kya?
SudHEER
Nahi Andhra se hoon mein.
SALIM ALI
TELUGU
Really? I’m from Rayalaseema District.
SUDHEER
TELUGU
What? My mother is from there, exactly where are you from?
Purushottam to his disbelief tries to stop Sudheer, but.. 
SALIM ALI
Tum kaha se ho?
PURUSHOTTAM
Jamshedpur.
SALIM ALI
Oh! Man Jamshedpur, Mini Bombay.
PURUSHOTTAM
Aap jaante ho?
SALIM ALI
Arre do saal kaam kiya hai mein waha. Beautiful city Man. 
Purushottam is proud of his home town.
Silence..
SaLIM ALI
You people seem dangerous(laughing inside). You sure room 41 is your room?
PuRUSHOTTAM
This is room 40.
SALIM ALI
Amma aiyo, no. What ra? engineers or what?
Salim opens the door and kicks them out.
SaLIM ALI
Ra, go to the owner, He will give you two space to enjoy. You look cute together.
He shuts the door on their face.
PuRUSHOTTAM
I told you, this dress won’t do.
SuDHEER
You sure he was Salim? Bohot achcha banda tha wo.
Purushottam calls-up the owner.
PURUSHOTTAM
Hello! Salim ka koi pic hai?
OwNER
Seriously? Tumlog Files kholte bhi nahi ho kya? Choro koi ni, room me ghus jao seedha.
PURUSHOTTAM
Irritated
Hum room 40 ke bahar khade hai.
OWNER
Kya murderer hai yaar tumlog, room 41 bola tha mein. Tumlog sure hai aise tumlog innocents ko nahi maarega, laparwahi mein?
Purushottam hangs-up the call.
PURUSHOTTAM
Hum sahi room gaye the.
SUDHEER
Seriously? He seemed so nice.
Purushottam gives him a death stare.
Knock! Knock!
Salim Ali opens the door.
PURUSHOTTAM
Salim?
SaLIM ALI
Kya re? Bola toh dusra room jao.
Purushottam pushes Salim, and they both enter the room. And they lock the door.
Infuriated, Salim Ali stands up.
SUDHEER
Bhai isko maarna zaroori hai?
Salim Ali, pumped up, comes running towards Purushottam and tries to punch him hard, but...
He dodges it, grabs the lamp, and smashes it on Salim’s head.
Salim falls on the floor, with his head...
--Bleeding...
SUDHEER
Sir pe nahi maarna tha.
Sudheer goes near the body to examine his head.
Purushottam notices Salim’s arm moving. But before he could warn Sudheer, with all the strength left in Salim, he gets up and pushes Sudheer against the wall.
Salim, like a Spartacus, heads towards Purushottam and breaks his left arm.
Calmly he sits on the bed, which, surprisingly, is in perfect condition.
He takes out his cigar, lights it up, and before he can smoke it, his eyes get stuck on Sudheer, searching for something.
SUDHEER
Puru gun nikal.
Salim, on hearing it turns his head towards Purushottam.
PURUSHOTTAM
Gun tumko lana tha.
SUDHEER
Chalana tujhe aata hai mein kyun launga?
PURUSHOTTAM
Laude!! I’m a hunter, she want to see my  gun,,,  tu gaa raha tha mirror ke saamne ki mein
SalIM ALI
When I pull it out boy, the woman starts to run.
The song starts to play in the background..
Sudheer realizes that he left the gun at home. 
He tries his best to get up, but he is not able to. 
Salim gets up and kicks Sudheer on his gut; blood rushes out of his mouth. Salim grabs Sudheer by his collar, and
BAM!!!
Salim is smashed with a chair, crashing one of its legs on the mirror, Shattering it, and a glass piece stabs Sudheer's shoulder. 
Salim, unaffected by the smash, turns back and kicks Purushottam hard, immobilizing him. 
Sudheer tugs out the splinter, with blood oozing out of the nasty wound, and in no time, he stabs Salim on the back. 
Salim falls, and so do Sudheer. 
Immobilized by their pain, Purushottam and Sudheer try to remain conscious. 
Salim crawls towards the door to open it.
FLASH BACK 1 CONTINUED - 
Purushottam with the knife in his hand tries to stab the man, but the muscular man pushes him hard.
Purushottam falls on the ground unable to stand up.
The man , stands in front of him, like a monster.
FLASHBACK 1 PAUSED. BACK TO THE SCENE - 
Sudheer grabs Salim’s leg and tries to stops him for a second, but with all the power left in him, Salim drags Sudheer with him.
Salim finally gets on his feet.
Purushottam with all the energy left in himself, stands up and shouts "Bhosdike." 
Salim turns back.
Both the monster and the Hunter stand still.
Both are lacking energy to move a single inch.
All of a sudden, Puru runs towards the beast and punches him right on his nose.
Salim falls down.
Purushottam stands victorious for a few seconds and Bam!!, he falls down, unconscious.
Sudheer drags himself towards Salim and with a splinter, he kills him.
Sudheer dials up the owner's number.
Few minutes later.
KNOCK! KNOCK!
The owner comes inside, sees the mess.
OWNER
Bandook se nahi maara?
SUDHEER
Gun bhool gaye the.
The owner is irritated..
OWNER
Gun? Bhool gaye the?
Looking at Purushottam.
ownER
Zinda toh hai?
The owner and sudheer together lift the dead body.
INT. VAN.
Sudheer, Purushottam are on one side and owner on the other, Purushottam is still finding it hard to open his eyes.

OWNER
Last hotel me jaha tumlogo ne murder kiya tha, wahi ka waiter hai. Iss month ke liye body mil gaya matlab?
PURUSHOTTAM
Criminal?
Smiling, the owner says..
OWNER
Ye tum decide kar lo.
From the pantry, the butcher brings a teenager(17, 5’7); tied with rope and mouth shut with tape.
The hunters feels a cold wind gonging right through them.
PURUSHOTTAM
Bachcha hai ye.
The owner rips open the tape. Purushottam kneels down near him and..
PURUSHOTTAM
Tumhe pata kaise chala?
TEENAGER
mein kuch khatra nahi banunga
OWNER
Sab yehi kyun bolte hai? Tum assume kaise karte ho mein darr kar ye sab kar raha hoon? Mazze se nahi.
Without paying him any attention, Purushottam signals the teenager to continue.
TEENAGER
Nitish!!! Jiska tumlogo ne Hotel me

waha naukri di thi,fir...(hesitates) unhone..(unable to finish his sentence), Didi ne
suicide kar liya aur police ko koi

OwNER
Tum inme se kisi ek ko maar do, toh tum Hunter bann sakte ho.(to them) Mein kisi ko force nahi kar raha, tumlog apas mein dekh lo. Democracy hai yanha full.
The owner goes back to his seat and is thrilled to see how this situation will unfold.
The teenager points the gun towards Purushottam.
SUDHEER
Don’t!!!... trigger pull mat karna.
Sudheer takes out his gun and points it towards the teenager.
PURUSHOTTAM
We can’t give in, Sudheer gun neeche karo, agar hum ek dusre ko nahi maarte toh ye humara kuch nahi bigad sakta.
OwNER
To kid
Mahine ka dedh lakh deta hoon, tumhara ghar sudhar jayega.
The teenager’s grip on the trigger tightens.
Sudheer slowly moves two steps forward, still aiming at the teenager’s neck.
Purushottam takes out his gun and points it towards the owner.
The owner smiles.
The kid redirects his aim towards the owner.
Sudheer and Purushottam have a big smile on their faces, but the owner, well his smile is ever bigger.
OWNER
Mujhe maar nahi sakte, trigger dabba ke dekh lo, magar uske baad, tum nahi bachoge. 
The butcher takes out his knife. The teenager gulps, and very quickly, he brings his gun back towards Purushottam, and before he could pull the trigger,
BAM!!!
The teenager is shot. One bullet hit him on his head and the other one on the neck. 
The smoke from the guns is dense, almost like fog.
As we see from above, The blood moves in all four directions, painting the floor in red, and no one moves an inch until blood reaches them, except the owner, his feet are high up above hanging from the table, swinging playfully.                     
The butcher starts dragging the body. He is not bothered to clean the floor.
Purushottam and Sudheer, like statues, are standing in the middle of the blood-covered floor.
Eventually becoming aware of his heartbeat, Purushottam turns his head towards Sudheer--
PURUSHOTTAM
To Sudheer
What did you do?
SudHEER
We survived.
PURUSHOTTAM
At what cost?
Silence...
Dejected, Puru keeps his gun in the preparation area. Sudheer is not sure what is Purushottam doing.
PURUSHOTTAM

Pakka?
SUDHEER
No!!!
PuRUSHOTTAM
Do you want to live to kill innocents?
Sudheer does not have any answer.
SUDHEER

The owner picks-up the gun and playfully points it towards Purushottam.
OwNER
Hum hunters ko nahi maarte, you are free to go, jaha jana hai.
SUDHEER
He is lying Puru, Take the fucking gun and we will figure out a way.
OWNER
Figure out what? Tumlog free ho jaane ke liye.
He takes a pack of biryani from a bag lying around and starts eating the biryani in it.
OWNER
Aao tumlog bhi kha lo.
They don’t move an inch.
After a couple of bites, he packs the biryani again.
OWNER
Tumlog police me mat jana, media me mat jana and you are free. Jaa kar kuch ukhaad nahi sakte, as you know, but we admire loyalty.
Silence...
OWNER
Baaki tumlog ko roz ka gosht(meat) nahi milega, naa hi monthly payments.
Sudheer, furiously starts to talk, only to be abruptly silenced by the owner.
OWNER
Um mm hmm mm, shhhhh,ch.. ch.. chup.. Tum dono ke pass bus do options hai. One-> continue 2--> shanti se nikal lo
The owner again unpacks the biryani and starts eating it, this time he is enjoying the bites.
He revolves around them, finally walking on the bloody floor.
OWNER
Don’t lie, ki tumhe ye meat tasty nahi lagte. isko dekh kar tumhare muh me paani nahi aate. 
He pats them both and says.. 
OWNER
Anyway, tumlogo ko chorna hai toh, (To sudheer) Apne guns mujhe de kar nikal jao.
Sudheer also keeps his gun in the preparation area, and With hesitance in their footsteps... 
They start to leave.
OWNER

Giving them the Biryani.
while leaving they leave behind their shoe marks on the bloody floor, eventually the blood erases their foot marks.
The butcher comes out of the pantry and gives the owner a note of two thousand rupees.

EXT.MAIN ROAD. 
The bike is standing at the side of the road.
The engine, still running.
The Biryani is hanging on the handle, swinging like a pendulum.
Purushottam is vomiting. Sudheer is standing still, emotionless.
PURUSHOTTAM
Why didn’t you throw it?
SUDHEER
This is the last meat we can have.
PuRUSHOTTAM
Breaking into tear
We have killed an innocent.
SUDHEER
Hummare pass koi option nahi tha.
PURUSHOTTAM
Option tha, but you pulled the trigger.
SUDHEER
Goli tumne bhi chalayi thi.
PURUSHOTTAM
Raising his voice
Tumne jab goli chalayi, Mein darr gaya aur out of impulse, I pulled the trigger.

Purushottam grabs the bag of biryani and throws it away.

“I’m sorry maa, I tried my best”
”Maa wo mujhe bully kar rahe the”
“Maa aaj mujhe naukri lagi”, 
“Maa aapko Piyusha bohot pyaari lagegi”
Finally we reach to an empty page.
“Maa, Mein apni jaan dene ko taiyaar tha, meine bandook bhi oonchi nahi ki thi, magar Sudheer, I see a mad hunter in him.”
He goes on filling the whole page, but we move away from him, seeing his frown converting to a smile, he eventually starts talking to the page.
We move away from him until we fade to black.

Int. party hall. Night-
A tiresome party is on, a band playing old Bollywood numbers, waiters giving food to very silent groups of people on different tables.
On one suck Table we see Piyusha, looking gorgeous in her black saree.
There are five others (three males and two ladies) on her table.
lady 1
They are saying that, the vigilante in the city are two cops.
man 3
Smirks
You believe cops will do this? 
lady 2
You do not like anything about country no?
man 3
It's not about country, it is about dog eat dog world. Why would any one with power will do any thing like this?
lady 2
To help? People who love the country? They exist.
While sipping his wine Man 4 says.
man 4
I think he is right, when was the last time some police helped you?
MAN 5
Always, my uncle is in police.
Lady 1
It does not matter who is with whom, this city is getting clean.
man 3
No one will help common people without their profit. May be one gang is killing another gang members.
lady 2
Or may be, The group already existed, but was not able to operate due to corrupt leadership. Leadership matters.
man 3
Then there should be such cops in every city?
lady 2
May be there is. Why do you think petrol prices are up? We need money to clean our nation.
Piyusha is dejected, not paying attention to their conversation.
Man 6 asks Piyusha.. "What do you feel?"
piYUSHA
I don't know, they feel legit. 
A waiter comes in with a tray full of wine. Every one take one glass except Piyusha.
man 6
Piyusha?
piYUSHA
Ah!! no 7 years clean.
They all look at her, a little bit shocked.
piYUSHA
Kya hua?
They say nothing.
man 3
3 mahine pehle hua tha naa last party apna.
piYUSHA
Shayad, haan..
man 3
smiling
That wasn't 7 years ago.
Piyusha is left with an awkward silence. 
While taking her bag she says...
piYUSHA
Sorry, He needs me, tabiyat theekh nahi.
She leaves.
man 4
Whispers inside the group
And other day, she was talking to a stranger about her abusive father. Her father died when she was 4, no one even found is body.
Piyusha overhears it. She is embarrassed.
Ext. cs BIRYANI. NIGHT - 
Sudheer parks his bike and goes inside.
Int. cs BIRYANI. contd - 
He orders special biryani for himself.
Within a few seconds, he gets it.
He eats a few bites, and from his expression, we know he dislikes it.
Int. neW ROOM(PURU'S). NIGHT-
Piyusha is changing her cloths. Purushottam is sitting on the bed.
PURUSHOTTAM
Party kaisa tha?
piyusha
Acha hi tha.
PURUSHOTTAM
Why are you changing cloths? Just drop them.
She takes out her lower and comes close to Purushottam.  He opens her bra and she stands in front of him topless. She lowers his pants and sits on top of him.
piyusha
While moaning
I love you.
Purushottam kisses her neck, licks it.
piyusha
I was thinking ki Supports group aur nahi jaate hai.
PURUSHOTTAM
Kyun?
piyusha
I don't want to lie any more.
Purushottam starts sucking her breasts. Her moans intensifies.
He is losing control on himself, he is desperate for meat.
PURUSHOTTAM
Kyun?
piyusha
I feel no glory in it now.
Purushottam very carefully puts her on bed and makes his way to her navel kissing her skin all along. 
piyusha
It is cowardly to live on lie.
Purushottam stops.
PURUSHOTTAM
Cowardly ?  How ? 
piyusha
If we are not comfortable with ourselves, life is meaningless.
PURUSHOTTAM
Don't lie about not lying.
She covers herself with the white blanket.
piyusha
Chhote motte jhooth bolna is okay, magar, I...
PURUSHOTTAM
I....
piyusha
I have started to live in the lie, I get offended when someone talks about my father, I refuse to drink because I'm 7 years clean.
PURUSHOTTAM
Isme problem kya hai?
piyusha
Are you comfortable with lying?
PURUSHOTTAM
Why do we lie?
piyusha
Because we fear.
PURUSHOTTAM
Fear whom?
piyusha
People.
PURUSHOTTAM
Society. But why?
piyusha
I don't know.
PURUSHOTTAM
Because we are not perfect? Or because they judge?
piyusha
Because they judge.
PURUSHOTTAM
Are they perfect?
piyusha
No.
PURUSHOTTAM
So why they judge?
Piyusha does not have any answer.
PURUSHOTTAM
Do they deserve truth?
Piyusha remains silent.
PURUSHOTTAM
No. And That is why we live in lie.
He slowly removes the blanket from her and starts kissing her. She is not kissing him with passion. 
He moves away from her lips and starts licking her neck. 
He slowly loses control and smells her in an unusual way. He starts to taste her, smell her, he treats her neck as a piece of meat and all of a sudden ----
----He bites her till she bleeds a little. Piyusha jumps up from the bed in pain.
piyusha
Shouting
What was that?
She presses her neck tightly. She is in immense pain.
piyusha
Say something.
He comes back to his senses.
PURUSHOTTAM
Zor se ho gaya?
piyusha
That was very much intentional. For what? I don't want to go to support group any more?
PURUSHOTTAM
No...No...No..no...no.... Mein hurt nahi karna chah raha tha.
She is staring at him with disgust.
PURUSHOTTAM
I'm not a man who beats women.
She starts to dress again.
piyusha
You! Man you are telling me what happened that night.
PURUSHOTTAM
What were you addicted to?
piyusha
When was the last time, I abused you because of that?
PURUSHOTTAM
Abuse? Yaar I have given you a dozen of hickies.
piyusha
Not once! Not once! And this, this is not hickies.
PURUSHOTTAM
Ye Abuse nahi tha.
piyusha
I have seen this before.
PURUSHOTTAM
You never had an abusive father. 
piyusha
I have met an abusive man, Puru-Sho-tam. I don't want to be with another one.
PURUSHOTTAM
That was just the story we made up.
As she is about to leave, he holds her hand.
PURUSHOTTAM
Please.
She tries to free her hand. Puru tightens his grip, but eventually he leaves her. Her arm is left with his finger marks. 
She hugs him, kisses him on his cheeks.
Piyusha -"Agar mein ab bhi addict rehti, toh tumko pata rehta sab, I'm hiding my past, not present."
Purushottam does not speak.
Piyusha - "Let me help, or make it your past."
She kisses him on his lips, one last time and she leaves.
Piyusha - "No one can abuse me, it starts small before it becomes unbearable."
Purushottam - "You are right, but I did not want to hurt you. seriously"
She leaves.
Int. cs BIRYANI. NIGHT -

Int. new drAWING HALL. NIGHT -
Completely dark, nothing could be seen clearly.
The main door is opened, Sudheer enters the home; from the light flooding in, we see Purushottam sitting next to the door, crying.
Sudheer closes the door, and quietly, he sits beside him.
Silence for a few seconds.
Purushottam breaks the silence - "Tum toh 5 din baad aane waala tha?"
Sudheer - "Piyusha?" 
Purushottam - "Chale gayi."
Sudheer - "It lasted longer than I thought."
Silence for a few seconds.
Purushottam - "Dude Switch on the light." 
Sudheer does that and Purushottam is staring at him.
Sudheer - "What?"
Purushottam - "Staring at you with burning fire in my eyes, just in enough control to not to hit you hard on your face."
Sudheer - "What?"
Purushottam - "Writing my novel. But the emotions are real."
Sudheer - "Why did she leave?"
PURUSHOTTAM - "Leave it. Why did you come back?"
Sudheer - "Leave it." 
PURUSHOTTAM - "She, left for no reason, She left for no fucking reason. feminazi"
Sudheer - "They are fucking bastards, trying to look good after ruining my childhood. We had everything when we were cleaning the city."
Purushottam stares at him, is he convinced by what Sudheer just said? May be! He is.
Purushottam - "Street side Biryani jiska sab bohot tareef karte the. kal challe?"
Sudheer - "Abhi chalte hai, Please."
Ext. narrow street. night - 
Purushottam and Sudheer are sitting outside a small food truck.
On the food truck there is a small television, news channel being played on it.
Their Biryanis are served, they take a couple of bites.
sudheer
How long have we not eaten anything from?
PURUSHOTTAM
Do weeks. Mein bus beer me zinda hoon.
They are not liking the taste.
On the food stall a few beggars come to ask for food, four of them are below 14, out of which three are in some way disabled, one blind, one with one leg and another with deformed face. 
The owner of the stall takes out his stick and the kids nub away.
stall owner
Sala mafia log dhandha bana diya hai. 
PURUSHOTTAM
Kaise?
stall owner
Ye bachcha log ek mahine pehle sab theekh tha, aisa kar diya ki log daya mein paisa de de.
PURUSHOTTAM
Toh bhaga kyun diye?
stall owner
Ye khaana nahi maangte, khaana khaate toh kya dikkat thi, paisa lete hai, aur sara fir gundo ko jaata hai.
PURUSHOTTAM
Kaise gunde?
stall owner
Wo sab Malaysia me baithe hai out of reach.
sudheer
Aapko kaise pata?
stall owner
Yanha sabko pata hai sir.
The stall owner goes back to the small kitchen.
Sudheer is staring at the kids.
pURUSHOTTAM
It is still not noble.
sudheer
Don't they deserve death more than criminals?
pURUSHOTTAM
We don't decide who deserves to live.
sudheer
Then who does?
Purushottam does not have any answer for this. On the news the news reporter is reporting about a rape case that happened a few days before.
The stall owner comes back, listening to the news he says..
stall owner
Ye police se kuch nahi hoga, ek paanch saal ki ladki ka rape ho jata hai, aur ye bus naya lead lead karte rehte hai.
sudheer
Bachche bhi safe nahi hai ab.
stall owner
Aur kya, yehi 9th phase me hua hai, Bangalore jaise sheher mein Rapist bachchi ko behla fusla ke aise jagah le jaata hai jaha CCTV nahi hai. Wo bhi police patrolling ke time. Inko bus wo log pakad sakte hai. Kya naam diya tha..
pURUSHOTTAM

Haan Batmen, Ye police se kuch nahi ho raha.
They both stare at each other.
stall owner
Ye poll karwate hai naa news channel, kal meine bhi vote kiya.

stall owner
Pooch rahe the ki rapist milega ki nahi milega, 90% log ne vote kiya ki Batmen ne maar diya hoga ab tak isiliye police ko nahi mil raha.
sudheer

stall owner
Meine kya, poora basti ko pata hai, Rapists ka khel khatam ho gaya hoga, humare basti me ek ladka hai Aslam, wo hatiyaar deta hai unhe.(he bends towards them and whispers), pichle saal se 31 log ko gayab kiya hai un do logo ne. Police ke hi log hai, tang aa gaye hai system se.
sudheer

stall owner
Kam hai ye toh. Aslam ke aane pe 31 hue hai, uss se pehle bohoto ko khatam kar chuke hai. Andar ki baat hai.
He goes back to the kitchen.
Purushottam and Sudheer starts to laugh, louder than they ever had.
pURUSHOTTAM

pURUSHOTTAM

Int. cs BIRYANI. NIGHT -
Raining outside.
The owner is closing the restaurant.
Wet floors, half shut shutter, green tint in the environment. Chairs kept on top of each other, tables pushed against the walls.
The light flickers!!
And we see a foot outside the restaurant, well dressed in a suit and shiny reflective shoes.
The figure pushes the shutter up and makes his way inside.
Red tie, White shirt beneath the suit, a black briefcase held with palm-covered with black glove and a crisp collar.
A handsome man enters with swag in his steps.
owNER
Salman..... It's not the time we attack.
salman
Mein recruit karne aaya hoon, mere pass do hunters hai, bus ek butcher baaki hai.
He gives him a paper, The owner reads it.

salman
Mere tarah (pause) Aah jo bhi hai, Mein isse recruit kar raha hoon, koi dikkat nahi?
The owner again looks back in the paper and when he looks up, Salman is not there.
From behind he hears - "Salman tha kya?"
The owner turns back and we see the butcher standing there.
owNER
Nahi, koi nahi tha.
butcher

Purushottam and the butcher smirk.
The owner looks at the butcher with anger in his eyes.

Owner is smiling. He signals the butcher to bring something.
The butcher goes inside the pantry.
owNER
Mein list nahi dunga. Magar jiss se list leta hoon, wo pagalo ke tarah naam bheje jaa raha hai.
sudheer
So give it to us.
owNER
You don't fight the darkness, you just get used to it.(In Japanese) So fucking get used to it.
The butcher comes up with a small glass tube.
owNER
3 ghante mein zinda ko laash bana ne sarva-uttam.
The butcher keeps it in Sudheer's pocket.
puRUSHOTTAM
Hum gun ke liye aaye hai.
owNER
Bachcho ko le aao, iss game ka level two bohot mazzedaar hai. You will get to kill real demons.
Purushottam slowly approaches the owner. He stands there for a second and does not move an inch.
puRUSHOTTAM
Hum laut aaye hai, galle toh mil lo.
The owner checks Purushottam, he is hiding nothing in his dress.
As the hug, Purushottam takes out a blade from his mouth and cuts the owners neck. It is a very small cut, but the owner bleeds.
puRUSHOTTAM
Anything that bleeds can be killed.
The butcher is shocked to see this.
The owner as usual has a smile on his face.
owNER
Jigra, sabse bada hatiyar.
The owner all of a sudden, brings down puru on his knees with a swift kick on his legs.
Grabs him by his hair and smashes it on the preparation area.
Bloody!! nose.
From butcher hands he takes his knife and grabs puru's hand, puts it on top of the preparation area and with a swing of the knife he cuts his --
Nails...
He picks up Puru's hand and checks his pulse.
owNER
Maut sabse buri sazza nahi. Ye dhadkan hai.
The butcher is looking at the owner with disbelief, his illusion of the owner being invisible is shattered.
The owner from his office brings the guns and gives it to them.
owNER
Body laane ke baad hi,Biryani milegi ab. Chalo jao. 
Purushottam is furious. They leave.
owNER
to the butcher
We all bleed.

Int. kiTCHEN. LATER IN THE NIGHT.
Koli's body is being chopped inside the Pantry. We can hear the knife cutting through the flesh.
The owner pats them both and gives them two packs of biryanis.
OWNER
Zeher hai naa?
Sudheer
Wo toh, toot gaya abhi.

Sudheer goes inside the pantry.
INT. PANTRY.
BLUE, COLD.
Meat of different animals are hanging. There is one more room inside the Pantry, knife cut can be heard coming from there.
Sudheer
Hello?
The butcher comes out.
butcher
Kya hua?
Sudheer
Bhaiya ni wo tube ke liye kaha hai.
The butcher brings a tube from the room and hands it over to sudheer.
As sudheer turns, he hits to a meat and falls down.
The butcher helps him get up and he leaves.
His gun is fallen on the ground, the butcher picks it up and goes towards the door to hand it back to Sudheer, But he stops at the door, thinks for a second, and keeps the gun in his pocket.
INT KITCHEN - 
Sudheer comes out of the pantry.
The owner has a very big smile on his face, he hugs sudheer and whispers - "Ek aur body aur tumko mein society me bohot bada position de dunga."
Purushottam hears some of it.
puRUSHOTTAM
Agar meat hum abhi laa rahe hai toh pehle se biryani?
oWNER
smiling
Hum meat deep freeze kar ke bhi rakhte hai.
Int. nEW DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT-
Sudheer and Purushottam are eating their biryani after days.
Cold beer, biryani and music......
They are having time of their lives, Again!!!
PURUSHOTTAM
Paise aa gaye?
sudheer

He gives him his phone.
sudheer
Akka apologized for her behavior , she fucking apologized.
PURUSHOTTAM
Bhaiya kya fuss fuss kar raha tha?
sudheer
Kuch nahi, bol raha tha ki agar aur bodies kal tak dete hai toh .. kuch kuch rewards dega.
He shows him the tube, it is full.
sudheer
Chill..
They increase the volume of the music.
A hookah glass lies there, they are taking drags one by one.
In one shot there are two bottles of bear and the time is 1 Am.
They are dancing like tribal people.
Another shot, there are 4 bottles of beer and they are lying on the floor at 2 AM
Another shot, no one is in the room, beer bottles, empty plate of Biryani. They enter the room with another 2 more bottles, it is 3 Am in the morning. 
PURUSHOTTAM
Itna vodka nahi peete bey, aur pi bhi nahi sakte.
sudheer
Challenge kar raha hai?
We move up to see the clock, after fifteen minutes we move down.
One vodka bottle is empty.
Now the dizziness in the screen is more visible.
Sudheer takes out his shirt and presses his chest.
sudheer
Ye dekh be chuchi, Biryaani kha kar chuchi bana liye hai bey. Piyusha se better hai naa.
Purushottam pinches his nipple.
PURUSHOTTAM
Abey nipple tera dabta hai bey.
sudheer

After a while,
They wear bed-sheets as cape and in the balcony the stand like superheros. 
sudheer
Ude kya?
PURUSHOTTAM
Nahi marr jayenge.
sudheer
Sala 7 khoon maaf hai mujhe, chal naa udte hai.
PURUSHOTTAM
Mootne ka dil hora bhai.
Sudheer suddenly bursts into tear.
sudheer
Bhai nani marr gayi.
PURUSHOTTAM

PURUSHOTTAM
Seriously

They hug each other and start to cry.
sudheer
Tu kyun ro raha?
PURUSHOTTAM

A man is passing from the street, he looks up and Purushottam starts urinating.
sudheer
Abey bhaag gaya sala moot hi toh hai.
PURUSHOTTAM

sudheer
Har party ke baad hote hai.

PURUSHOTTAM
Abey nani toh 87 me marri thi, tu 96 me aaya.
sudheer
Wahi bey logo ka baat nahi sunn na chahiye, koi logic nahi hota sala.
Eventually they fall asleep in the balcony.

EXT. FLEE MARKET. NIGHT  
The market is closed and no one except a few beggars and dogs are on the pavement of the street.
The butcher opens a shutter to it’s quarter length and enters inside.
A man is sleeping inside.
The butcher wakes him up.
The man
Kya hua?
BUTCHER
Ye gun thoda check kar na, chal nahi raha.
THE MAN
Time dekha hai?
BUTCHER
Kal free Biryani laa dunga.
The man gets up from his sleep and examines the gun.
THE MAN
Ruk khol kar dekhta hoon.
He goes inside another room, and in a minute returns back with the gun and a microchip.
THE MAN
Ye sensor controlled safe lock lagaya hai re tu.
BUTCHER
Maane?
THE MAN
Matlab button se control kar sakta hai tum ki gun chalega ki nahi.
BUTCHER
Kaun sa button?
THE MAN
Gun ke saath aisa lock nahi milta, lagwana padta hai, fir button se control kar sakta hai, Jisne lagwaya hoga uske pass hoga re button.
The butcher takes the gun, and he has a big smile on his face.
Ext. Outside shop. Moments later - 
The butcher comes out of the shop, a dog is barking at him.
BUTCHER
Ye le gun aur chala mere par.(laughing) 7 khoon maaf hai mereko, ab tak 4 hi kiya hai.
He sits on the ground.
BUTCHER
Le try kar mujhe maarne ka. Lund ? Lund hai tere pass? Nahi saali kutiya jo ho. Mein laga dega ek lund, aaja society me.
He starts to laugh loudly and he is crying as well.
CUT TO:
Int. NEW BALCONY. night- 
The sun rays hits the eyes of the hunters.
Reluctantly they wake up.

PURUSHOTTAM

sudheer

PURUSHOTTAM
Koi bhi chalte hai.
Int. neW DRAWING ROOM. night
Television is switched on. Purushottam is about to switch it off, but he is shocked.
Sweat starting to crawl down from his forehead, eyes getting red.
"Shakti rape case me bohot bada khulasa, retired police officer Aditya Rana ne apne gunaoho ko kiya confess.
Iss waqt ki badi kharab, Kya team Bat-men se darr kar inhone confess kiya?"
Sudheer switches the television off.
Purushottam losses his control over himself. tears pouring out from his eyes, guilt getting heavier in his chest.
He is finding it difficult to breathe, Sudheer is trying to calm him down, but Purushottam has lost it.
He pushes Sudheer and runs towards the balcony to breathe fresh air.
He is saying once sentence over and over and over.
- "We have killed one more innocent."
Sudheer is saying something, but Purushottam's voice is dominating Sudheer's voice.
Sudheer slaps Purushottam hard.
Heart beat!!!!
Purushottam rushes to his room.
Int. neW ROOM(PURU'S). continuous
Purushottam keeps his phone on a tripod and is about to make a video.
Sudheer snatches the phone.
sudheer
Shouting
Kya kar raha hai?
PURUSHOTTAM
Justice..
sudheer
Ye justice nahi hai. chutiyaap hai.
PURUSHOTTAM
We have killed an innocent. Three murders.
sudheer
3?
PURUSHOTTAM
In pain
Maa, detective koli.
sudheer
Maa?
Purushottam in shock, reiterates - "we have killed an innocent."
Sudheer from outside brings a bottle of beer and puts it beside Purushottam.
sudheer
Koli ho ya Rana, criminal dono the, there is no way Koli ko nahi pata hoga ye sab.
Purushottam grabs him by his collar.
PURUSHOTTAM
He was crying ki usne nahi kiya.
sudheer
we both know wo jhooth bol raha tha. I will give you time, mein room se jaa raha, (phone mere pass rahega), think wisely.
He leaves the room.
Int. draWING HALL. NIGHT
Sudheer locks Purushottam's door and calls up someone.
Int. kiTCHEN(OFFICE). night 

The owner is searching for something in the left topmost drawer of the table. 

There are three drawers on both sides of the table.
The owner sits on, and his eyes move towards the right drawer.

He slowly opens it and finds the gun.

He picks it up and loads the gun.

He presses a button on his watch, but the gun is still not unlocked.

With a smile on his face, he keeps the gun back in the left drawer.

The Butcher enters the scene with lunch in his hand and puts it on the table.
butcher
Aapka dinner.
The owner pulls the drawer slightly and gets in a position from where he can easily grab the gun if needed.
The owner smells the food and say--
OWNER
Baitho, khana kha liya?
butcher
Han.
The owner starts to eat salad, and then, he slides the plate towards the butcher.
OWNER
Eat.
The owner keeps the gun on the top of the table.
butcher
Aghori aur bayra, dono ko 7 khoon maaf hote hai.
OWNER
Han.
butcher
Toh jab kisi ko bayra banaya jaata hai, ye test toh hota hoga? How did you cheat it?
OWNER
7 Khoon maaf hota hai, amar nahi banta koi.
butcher
Mujhe sab sach lagta tha.
OWNER
Sab sach hai.
butcher
In dono ke liye meat kaha se laate hai? Saare meat toh hum upar bhej dete hai. 
OWNER
Sab bataunga.
butcher
bata?
OWNER
abhi ? abhi dinner time hai.(shameless smile on his face)
butcher
Kuch sach nahi tha? Swarg? 72 hoor? Moksha? gaddi? 
OWNER
Myths may be false, but the power, position, society , ye sach hai. Don't you want power?
The butcher thinks for sometime and grabs the gun from the table.
butcher
Madarchod hai tu.
We  move down for a second to see that the owner is holding another gun beneath the table, pointing towards the Butcher.
OWNER
Agar ye sab sach nahi hai? Toh raat me farsh se khoon apne aap kaise saaf ho jata hai?
butcher
Jaise bandook humesha jam ho jata tha.
The butcher throws away the gun and from his jacket he takes out an old revolver.
butcher
Ye jam nahi hoga.
oWNER
Society me kabhi bhi bahar se aadmi nahi aate the, you know why did I choose you?
The owner tightens his grip on the revolver.
OWNER
I need a team, hum mil kar iss society ke top me jaa sakte hai, we can rule over the world. Mujhko maarne ke baad kidhar jaoge? Do you know a single minister?
The Butcher moves away from the table, forcing the Owner to bring out his gun in the open.
The owner pulls the trigger,
The gun was jammed.
The butcher, with an evil smile on his face says... "oops!!"
The owner tries to shoot multiple times, but it is jammed.
The owner throws the gun, puffed chest with pride, slightly tilted towards left, he accepts his fate.
The butcher aims the gun at the owners head. The owner keeps smiling.
His pride overtakes his fear, he is not afraid of death, is he really invincible ? or this is another bluff?
oWNER
Jigra hai mere pass, chal goli.
The butcher changes his aim to his heart.
butcher
Jigra tha.
As we hold our breath, an ominous music enters the scene.
Things slow down...
He shoots a bullet, muzzle flash, spark and a bullet slowly moving forward, exciting the frame.
As we follow the bullet, things come back to normal speed and the bullet hits right in the heart of the owner.
Silence.
The music reaches it peak.
The owner falls down, breaking the chair behind.
The butcher takes out a cigarette from his shirt pocket and smokes it. He does not know what to do next, he slowly goes towards the body and is shocked to see no blood on the floor.
He turns the body.
No blood, No wound. He puts his finger beneath the owner's nose.
No breath. 
But, as soon as he is relaxed......
The owner opens his eyes, and takes out the knife from the butcher's pocket and stabs him straight in his shoulder.
The butcher falls down, in unbearable pain.
The owner takes out the metal plate from his shirt's pocket, the bullet is stuck in it.
Blood spatting out of his shoulder,like a fountain of blood.
oWNER
Jigra, kismat aur dimag,fir kaise na ho saat khoon maaf.
Int. new DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT-
Purushottam comes out of the room, holding the beer bottle, half empty.
Sudheer, nervously, almost in shock, cuts a call abruptly.
Purushottam, waits for a few seconds, has his suspicion on Sudheer, but he doesn't care and he goes on to say.
purUSHOTTAM
We will make one video, confess and face the trial.
Sudheer
And? Koi saboot nahi milega kisi ko bhi, media humme pagal saabit kar degi, nuksaan sirf hummara hai. Ye society as it is rahega, new hunters aayenge jo monsters honge.
purUSHOTTAM
2 innocents. In 2 months.
Sudheer
1 INNOCENT. KOLI bhale rape nahi kiya, magar wo mila hua hai.
purUSHOTTAM
Nahi, iska koi saboot nahi, usko bhaiya ne kitne araam se chutiya banaya tha, Rana bhi khel raha hoga uske saath.
Sudheer
How?
purUSHOTTAM
Kyun ki he was fighting for Justice, hummare tarah.
Sudheer
Usne ek baat sahi ki thi, justice ke liye koi kuch nahi karta, reward ke liye karte hai.
purUSHOTTAM
Toh ab hum criminals bann jaaye?
Sudheer
World is already unfair, aur haan we should get used to the darkness.
purUSHOTTAM
Tum bachcho ko ab maaroge? Agar aur criminals nahi mile?
Sudheer
Why do we kill criminals?
purUSHOTTAM
Kyun ki we need to make the city safer.
Sudheer
Safe kiske liye? Logo ko zindigi better karne ke liye?
purUSHOTTAM
Obviously.
Sudheer
Meat ke liye thoda bhi nahi?
Purushottam is silent, words are fighting in his head, he desperately wants to speak, his face goes red, but he does not have any answer to the question.
purUSHOTTAM
If I'm willing to confess, mujhe
Sudheer
Tujhe bus achcha dikhna hai.
purUSHOTTAM
Kiske saamne?
Sudheer
Mere.
Purushottam bursts into tears.
sudheer
Pulwama attack ke waqt tumne kitna donate kiya tha?
purUSHOTTAM
You know jitna ho sakta tha, amount kam tha.
sudheer
Raj ke papa ke death ke time?
purUSHOTTAM
Paise nahi the, magar jitna ho saka tha utna donation link share kiya tha?
sudheer
ye baat mujhe kaise pata?
purUSHOTTAM
Kyun ki tumse discuss kar ke kiya tha.
sudheer
Aur groups me messages kiye the.
purUSHOTTAM
Point kya hai?
sudheer
Pulwama attack mein tune photoshop kiya tha bill, Raj ke father ke death ke time saale 6th month thi 25,000 joining bonus mila tha. You are just a bloody show off, bus image chahiye.
Sudheer gives him his phone.
sudheer
pandrah minutes pehle, mujhe lag raha tha ki tu sach me confess karega, bhool gaya tha tu bus dikhawa hai, le ab kar.
Purushottam takes the phone and he hesitates to make the video.
Purushottam looks at Sudheer, he can see memories of the past, the past where Sudheer is laughing like a mad person after killing Koli, when he advocated to kill children.
Sudheer starts laughing.
purUSHOTTAM
Will you kill poor?
sudheer
We kill criminal to clean the city, in bachcho ki zindigi nark se bhi battar hai, we must show mercy and have easy money.
purUSHOTTAM
Aaj isko justify kar rahe ho, kal rape karoge, fir innocents ko maaroge. Tum bole the dusre hunters me monster hoga. I see a monster with in you.
sudheer
Sorry!!! Aisa nahi hoga, Sorry!! You won't be alive to see that day.
purUSHOTTAM
Now you will kill me?
Sudheer does not answer.
purUSHOTTAM
Koli pe goli tumne chalayi, bachcho ko tum maroge, detective ko tumne maara. Justice is...
In no time Purushottam takes out his gun and shoots sudheer on his neck.
Silence.
The body does not fall, Sudheer is finding it difficult to breathe, too much of blood.
He falls down, still trying to breathe, the bullet is stuck in his neck.
purUSHOTTAM
Killing monsters, is justice. 
From Sudheer's pocket, Purushottam takes out his phone.
He texts The owner - "A body is ready, my house, come fast."
The call bell rings.
Purushottam panics. He does not have time to
